# Apex-0
Apex 0 is a remote controlled plane.
 I am making a Trainer plane. fully DIY of course using some modules :)
 It will have four controls (Throttle, Ailerons, Rudder and Elevator) 
 I will be using ESP32 along with NRF24l01+PA+LNA for communication and controlling servos and throttle.

I am referring to this video : https://youtu.be/LzZ4Oqk_J1Y?si=26B0NShiXBWvZHp2
for structure part...but there was a flaw...The flight time...I have optimized the design for longer flight time
and also made my own remote control.
